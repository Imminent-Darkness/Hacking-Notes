# Hacking
This repository serves as my personal hacking notebook/toolbox. It is a quick reference guide to easily repeat previously successful attacks methods. Things I have committed to memory, stuff easily locatable in man pages, and quickly googleable information are purposely left out.   

This repository will be continually updated and changed throughout my cybersecurity career. I hope you find it as helpful as I do :)
