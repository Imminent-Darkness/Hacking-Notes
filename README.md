# Hacking
This repository serves as my personal hacking notebook/toolbox and is shared with the world. Common Knowledge, things I have committed to memory, and quickly googleable information are purposely left out. 

This repository will be continually updated and changed throughout my cybersecurity career. I hope you find it as helpful as I do :)
