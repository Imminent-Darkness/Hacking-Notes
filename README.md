# Hacking Notes

By far my favorite repository on GitHub...

This repository serves as my personal hacking notebook/toolbox. It is a quick reference guide to easily repeat previously successful attack methods. Things I have committed to memory, stuff easily locatable in man pages, and quickly googleable information are typically purposely left out. Furthermore, since this is a living repository and is constantly being updated, the organization of information is not the best; however,  I try to organize it the best I can, but it is tough since I have no idea what information is going to be added next from day to day as I am constantly learning new and unexpected things.

This repository will never be finished and will be continuously updated throughout my cybersecurity career. I hope you find it as helpful as I do! :)
