# Hacking
This repository serves as my personal hacking notebook/toolbox. It is a quick reference guide to easily repeat previously successful attacks methods. Things I have committed to memory, stuff easily locatable in man pages, and quickly googleable information are purposely left out.   

This repository will never be finished and will be continuously updated throughout my cybersecurity career. I hope you find it as helpful as I do :)
