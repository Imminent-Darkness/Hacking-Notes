## Basic Programming Concepts

+ Logic Constructs
  - Loops
    + `var1=$(cat /etc/passwd | awk '{FS = ":"} {print $1}')`
      `for i in $var1`
      `do`
      `echo "Username : " $i`
      `done`

  - Conditional Statements
    + Invoke Ruby with `irb`
    + ```user1 = `grep dlowrie /etc/passwd | cut -d ":" -f 1`
    ```
    `if user1 == "dlowrie"`
    `print "User found!"`
    `else`
    `print "User not found!"`
    `end`
  - Boolean Operator
  - String Operator
  - Arithmetic Operator
+ Data Structures
  - JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
    + ```
      >>> import json
      >>> x = '{ "name":"Dan", "age":41, "title":"Edutainer" }'
      >>> y = json.loads(x)
      ```
  - Dictionaries
    + Key:Value pairs
      - "brand": ITProTV
  - CSV
  - Lists and Arrays
    + Both store data
    + Both are changeable (mutable)
    + Both can be indexed and iterated through
    + Both can be sliced
    + Arrays are optimized for arithmetic operations
    + Arrays are containers for elements of the same data type
    + Arrays must be declared
    + Lists are containers for elements with different data types
    + Lists can be created ad-hoc
  - Binary Search Trees
+ Libraries
  - Libraries are collections of pre-written code that users can use to optimize
    tasks.
+ Classes
  - Informs the attributes of an Object
    + ```
      class User:
        def __init__(self,Name,Account,SubLevel): #constructor
          self.name = Name
          self.account = Account
          self.sublevel = SubLevel

      u1 = User("Ronnie", 1001, "Premium")
      ```
+ Procedures and Functions
  - Procedures
    + List of commands executed in order
    + Doesn't return a value or anything
  - Functions
    + List of commands executed in order
    + Returns a value

## Analyze Scripts Or Code For Use In A Pentest

+ Shells
  - Bash
  - PowerShell
+ Programming Language
  - Python
  - Ruby
  - Perl
  - JavaScript
+ Analyze Exploit Code To:
  - Download/Upload Files
  - Launch Remote Access
  - Enumerate Users
  - Enumerate Assets


## Opportunities for Automation

- Automate Penetration Testing Process
  + Perform a port scan then automate next steps based on results
  + Check configurations and produce a report
- Scripting to modify IP Addresses during a test
- Nmap Scripting to enumerate ciphers and produce reports
