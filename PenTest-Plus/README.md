# PenTest+

This repository is filled with things that I found interesting while studing for the CompTIA PenTest+ exam. These notes are not necessarily critial to pass the exam, although they might help. Some exam topics may not be listed in these notes. These notes are here for me to reference during real penetration engagements and CTFs.
