# PenTest+ PT0-002

This repository is filled with things I found interesting while studying for the CompTIA PenTest+ exam. These notes are not necessarily critical to pass the exam, although they might help. Some exam topics may not be listed in these notes. These notes are here for me to reference during real penetration engagements and CTFs.
