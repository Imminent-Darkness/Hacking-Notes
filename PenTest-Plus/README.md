# PenTest+ PT0-002

This repository contains things I found interesting while studying for the CompTIA PenTest+ exam. More common and lower-level information is purposely excluded, as the PenTest+ assumes you have a base understanding of fundamentals before starting the exam. Because of that, some exam topics may not be listed in these notes. Instead, these notes are primarily here for me to reference during actual penetration engagements and CTFs more than to help me pass the exam.
